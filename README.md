# ðŸ§  ANN Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to predict customer churn based on historical data.  
It demonstrates how machine learning can be used to identify customers likely to leave a service.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict customer churn using deep learning.
- **Dataset:** Bank Customer Churn dataset (CSV format).
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
- **Notebook:** `ANN_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`
